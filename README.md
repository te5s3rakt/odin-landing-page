**Odin Project - Foundations**

**Project: Landing Page**

For this project Iâ€™ll be creating an entire web page from a design The Odin Project provided for me. If I'd been following along I should have the skills I need to accomplish this, but it may not be easy!

The design The Odin Project provided me came in the form of 2 images: one was an image of the complete website, and one had some details about some of the fonts and colors used.

**PS.** I'd like to thank the following creators on Pexels.com for the images used in the final build.
